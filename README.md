# readable

This is my submission for the readable project of the Udacity React Nanodegree, a content and comment web app built using React and Redux. 

## Prerequisites
You need to have npm installed on your computer

## Installing the app
To run the project, download or fork this repository. Then navigate to the project folder using:
```
> cd front-end
```
Install the dependencies using:
```
> npm install
```

Once all the dependencies have been installed (this may take a few minutes), type `npm start` or `yarn start` in the same directory to launch the app. 

The project will now be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Installing the back-end server
To install the API server, navigate to the api-server using:

```
> cd api-server
```

Then install the dependencies using:
```
npm install
```

In the same directory, type:
```
node server
```
to start the API server. It will now run from http://localhost:3001.
